	<div class="entry-content"><p>This week I&rsquo;m taking a look at three websites I use regularly and jotting down some thoughts about my experience navigating them. All three provide a superb product and their sites are reflective of their unique brands and audiences.</p>

<h4><a href="https://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a></h4>

<p>I love the service Soundcloud provides; they&rsquo;ve revolutionized streaming audio and created a massive community of podcast and music-lovers. The page&rsquo;s central focus is an image of someone wearing headphones or near a device (demonstrating the functionality clearly), and includes, in bold text, a direct call to action: &ldquo;Hear the world&rsquo;s sounds.&rdquo; It provides a gateway to the trove of audio in a simple way that is: bright, transparent, inspiring, clear, and, well, pretty.
It&rsquo;s very clear how one can sign up, search, and explore. Browsing is very easy and the three-color scheme is handsome. It doesn&rsquo;t sell anything up front other than joining the community. The site more than does its job: I ended up browsing instead of writing this.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.artic.edu/">The Art Institute of Chicago</a></h4>

<p>I have a strong affinity for the Art Institute; it&rsquo;s a vitally important art museum. My eye is drawn to the changing exhibition images at the center, which show what is on at the museum. Overall, though, there&rsquo;s no central focus and lots of clutter. I&rsquo;d describe the site as colorful, cluttered, inconsistent, content-rich, and confusing. It is hard to sift through the many available options (many of which seem similar), and it is hard to browse the site. I feel overwhelmed and distracted after spending too much time with it. It sells the experience of visiting, but most likely those visiting the site are already sold on it.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.vfiles.com/">Vfiles</a></h4>

<p>I love Vfiles&mdash;it&rsquo;s the commerical and social media hub of the growing New York&mdash;based streetwear resurgence. They have great visual and video content and provides an enjoyable way of staying on top of streetwear trends.
On the site, I&rsquo;m drawn to the central logo and scrolling Ms. Piggy images&mdash;-it very succinctly communicates the weird-is-good identity of the brand. It&rsquo;s elegant, fun, silly, simple, and organized. It&rsquo;s also quite easy to find out which direction to head from the toolbar. I&rsquo;ve made purchases before so the site does a good job of making the experience as enjoyable as the products it sells.</p>
