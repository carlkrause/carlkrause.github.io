	<div class="entry-content"><p>Pair programming is a huge part of the Dev Bootcamp curriculum and I&rsquo;m just getting my feet wet. In past jobs I&rsquo;ve worked very closely with coworkers on projects, often sitting at a computer with someone as one person comes up with copy or e-mail text and the other types and offers instant feedback. It forces both people to focus on quality <em>and</em> getting it done quickly.</p>

<h4>Pairing</h4>

<p>This week I was a little behind the curve with pairing: my first two weeks of Phase 0 were particularly busy at work and I missed out on a few pairing opportunities. Nonetheless, when I started pairing this week I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>First of all, it was so emotionally helpful to put a face to my peers&#8217; names and see that they were struggling with the same concepts I was. My feeling the first week was that I was so far behind and would struggle to catch up, but just working through problems and chatting was immensely helpful in making me realize that if I A) did all the work and B) continued to have enthusiasm for my learning I was going to meet my goals.</p>

<p>I have found that pairs have very different ways of thinking and working. The two people I paired with this week were polar opposites. I&rsquo;m always a back-of-the-napkin outliner who then charges into the task when I have a very loose framework. It&rsquo;s not a bad attribute because I can brainstorm different ways of doing things, but ultimately a pair who says &ldquo;OK, let&rsquo;s focus on one approach, give it depth, and get it done&rdquo; complements my working style. That&rsquo;s not to say pairing with a person just like me is bad: I ended up learning a lot when pairing when someone much like myself, though our productivity wasn&rsquo;t as high.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m learning my style and also ways to manage myself in a pair. I think I need more practice before I can understand how best to conduct myself in pair programming, but the two I paired with this week were really smart and enthused and I got so much out of each experience.</p>

<h4>Feedback</h4>

<p>Because I got a late start with pairing, unfortunately I&rsquo;ve only received feedback from our GPS guide. The feedback I received was concise but helpful&mdash;â€”I was doing well but needed to review loops (which I did and found very helpful).</p>

<p>I read and rated at least 20 other students&#8217; feedback this week. It&rsquo;s definitely helped me write better feedback for my pairs. It&rsquo;s something I enjoy doing because I felt like we built trust during the sessions and I know that giving constructive feedback will help me receive and be receptive to constructive feedback.</p>

<p>The most difficult thing when writing feedback is how to provide actionable suggestions. When my knowledge of things isn&rsquo;t 100% I feel like I can&rsquo;t properly say whether or not someone needs more work on something.</p>

<p>Overall, I really enjoyed my pairing this week: it&rsquo;s already proving a great productivity tool and much more fun than staring at a screen alone.</p>
